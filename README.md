Looking at the inflation graph we can see the Bank of England's 2% aim was surpassed as the U.K. exited 
Lockdown measures as demand increased and supply side issues could not keep up. The Russian invasion 
of Ukraine compounded inflation problems as energy and grain resources became reduced due to embargoes 
placed on Russia and the decimation of the Ukrainian grain trade routes.
Further economic instability was introduced by Liz Truss's Mini-budget.
