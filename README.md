#The U.K. has had an issue with inflation for the last couple of years.
-
[Looking at the inflation graph](https://github.com/a-damC/module10_ONS/blob/main/pdfs_main/inflation_last_5_years.pdf) we can see the Bank of England's 2% aim was surpassed as the U.K. exited 
Lockdown measures as demand increased and supply side issues could not keep up. The Russian invasion 
of Ukraine compounded inflation problems as energy and grain resources became reduced due to embargoes 
placed on Russia and the decimation of the Ukrainian grain trade routes.
Further economic instability was introduced by Liz Truss's Mini-budget.


#The Input-Output Table

[The increase in energy prices](https://www.ons.gov.uk/economy/inflationandpriceindices/articles/theenergyintensityoftheconsumerpricesindex/2022) have many businesses and households worried
about the future.
[The Input-Output Table](https://github.com/a-damC/module10_ONS/blob/main/data/clean_IOT_data.csv) shows the value in million of pounds of how each industry's outputs are dependent on other
industry's output for input.

[Here is a Heatmap](https://github.com/a-damC/module10_ONS/blob/main/pdfs_main/figure2_IOT_heatmap.pdf) visualisting this data.
It can be seen here some industries are very dependent on a lot of others industries such as construction,public administration, and less so education.
